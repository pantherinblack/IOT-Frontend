    <h2>Welcome to our IoT temperature logger website!</h2>
    <p>Our website is dedicated to providing you with accurate and reliable temperature data through the use of our state-of-the-art IoT temperature logging system. Our system utilizes advanced sensors that are placed in strategic locations to measure temperature and humidity levels in real-time.</p>
    <p>Whether you are monitoring the temperature in your home, office, warehouse, or any other space, our IoT temperature logging system will provide you with accurate and up-to-date temperature data that you can use to make informed decisions about your environment.</p>
   <p>We are proud to say that this website was a group project (IDPA) created by Diego Fantino, Andras Tarlos and Kevin Stupar. As a team, we worked hard to design and develop this IoT temperature logging system to provide you with accurate and reliable temperature data.</p>
    <p>Each team member brought their unique skills and expertise to the project, and together, we were able to create a high-quality product that we are all proud of. Diego was responsible for the design/user interface of the website and the Database, while Andras and Kevin focused on the backend development of the IoT sensors and data logging system.</p>
    <p>We are grateful for the opportunity to work together on this project and are excited to share our product with you. We hope that our IoT temperature logging system will be useful to you and that it will provide you with the information you need to make informed decisions about your environment.</p>
    <p>Thank you for visiting our website, and we appreciate your support for our group project.</p>
